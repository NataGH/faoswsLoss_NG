\usage{
SaveData(domain, dataset, data, metadata, normalized = TRUE,
  waitMode = "wait", waitTimeout = 600, chunkSize = 50000)
}
\arguments{
\item{domain}{A character value specifying the domain for which the code
list is required.}

\item{dataset}{A character value specifying the dataset for which the code
list is required.}

\item{data}{A data.table object containing keys, data and flags.}

\item{metadata}{A data.table object containing the metadata.}

\item{normalized}{Logical, indicates whether data is in a normalized or
denormalized format.}

\item{waitMode}{A character string indicating how to behave with respect to
the backend.  Should be either "wait", "forget", or "synch".  "wait" allows
R to routinely check for completion of the save, up to pullTimeout seconds.
"forget" returns control to R immediately without verifying that the object
has been saved (this can be dangerous if the object is accessed later).
"synch" gives the writing process a short time period, and returns an error
if the write fails.}

\item{pullTimeout}{An integer giving the number of seconds to allow for the
write process to the database before returning an error.}
}
\value{
No object is returned, as this function just writes data to the
SWS.
}
\description{
This is the main function used to write data back to a user's session.  The
data must be in a particular format, and thus it's recommended to first
read data via GetData, modify the data.table, and then write it back to the
database with this function.
}
\details{
Also, this function will throw an error if you attempt to write to invalid
data.  For example, some countries have restrictions on which time period
they have data (as they recently became a country, or are no longer a
country).  See ?GetCodeList.
