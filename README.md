# Installing this package

## Where to install
This package can installed by running the R command:

`install.packages("faosws", repos="http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org/fao-sws-cran/", type="source")`

If you are not on the FAO internal network, this will not work. At all.

## But I have a tar.gz, tgz or zip file

`install.packages("path to faosws", repos=NULL)`

# Loading this package

Once the package is installed, you can use:

`library(faosws)`

This will load the package. To get started, look at the package help file:

`?faosws` OR `help(faosws)`
